        How Daraz Transformed Online Shopping in Pakistan <br />
        Daraz first made waves in Pakistan’s e-commerce market after its
        introduction in 2012. We have since grown to become Pakistan’s largest
        platform for online shopping with a network spread across Asia in
        Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, and Daraz.com.np. Our vision
        was to provide a safe, efficient online marketplace platform for vendors
        and customers across the country to come together. We started off
        exclusively as an online fashion retail platform and over the years
        expanded to become a complete one-stop solution for all your buying
        needs. Daraz prides itself on not being just another ecommerce venture
        in Asia. We work tirelessly to make sure that we provide users with the
        best online online shopping experience and value for their purchases.
        Whether you shop online through our website or our online shopping
        mobile App, you can expect easy navigation, customized recommendations,
        and a smooth online shopping experience guaranteed.
